# The original script had a generic 'npm i' which typically installs dependencies from a package.json.
# Since no package.json was provided, no specific npm packages are listed here by default.
# If you install global npm packages (e.g., 'npm install -g <package>'), list them here, one per line.
# Example: nodemon
# Example: typescript
